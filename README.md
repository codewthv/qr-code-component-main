**My Process**

**Built With**

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Mobile-first workflow

**What I Learned**

This project helped me get familiar with using Tailwind CSS through the CDN method. It made my styling process much faster and more structured. I was able to apply utility classes directly to HTML elements and avoid writing separate CSS rules.

**A few things I learned:**

<!-- Centering using flexbox and Tailwind utilities -->
<div class="m-auto bg-gray-100">
  <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl text-center">
    <img src="image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="rounded-lg w-100" />
    <h1 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</div>


Tailwind helped me keep the styling inline and focused, especially with classes like rounded-lg, shadow-lg, and text-center.

**Continued Development**
I plan to continue practicing with Tailwind CSS, especially:

- Responsive design and breakpoints

- Grid and flexbox layout systems using Tailwind

- Building reusable components using utility-first classes

- Also, I want to explore using Tailwind with frameworks like React or Vue in the future.

**Useful Resources**
- Tailwind CSS Documentation – The official docs were very clear and helpful. It was my main reference for learning utility classes.
- Frontend Mentor's Community – Browsing through others’ solutions gave me good ideas for structure and layout.
